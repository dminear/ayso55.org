### Referee Points for Fall 2016

<!--
The point system has been revamped this year.  Here's the deal:

Each team playing in the U10 through U14 divisions is required to earn a minimum number of referee points to be eligible for playoffs.

Please don't let your child's team be the one to be excluded from the playoffs due to insufficient referee points.  The time to sign up and earn points in **now**.  The region board will not be receptive to requests for exceptions to earning the minimum number of required points.

Minimum referee point requirements differ by division.  The minimum referee points required for the teams that you are earning points for are as follows:

* U10 - 140 points in Weeks 1-7 and 60 points in Weeks 8-10

* U11 Extra - 98 points in Weeks 1-7 and 42 points in Weeks 8-10

* U12 - 196 points in Weeks 1-7 and 84 points in Weeks 8-10

* U13 Extra - 126 points in Weeks 1-7 and 54 points in Weeks 8-10

* U14 - 126 points in Weeks 1-7 and 54 points in Weeks 8-10


Referees and AR's will earn points as follows:
