### 2016 Spring Referee Scheduler

<!--

U6 and U8 - home team provides the referee.

U10 and U12 - sign in to the [Region 55 Ref Scheduler](http://www.schedulesetc.com/referee/index.asp?id=reg55nhb15F) - all these games are in the region.

U14 and up - 
-->

sign in to the [Area K Ref Scheduler](http://www.schedulesetc.com/referee/index.asp?id=Area11KE16S) - these games are among regions.

If you do not have an account then send an email to the Referee Administrator. A [guide](/docs/Using-the-Region-55-Referee-Scheduler.pdf) to use the scheduler is available, but the link is different for every season -- use the link above or substitute the correct year in the URL.  That is reg55nhb14F becomes reg55nhb15F for "region 55 north huntington beach 2015 fall". You get the idea.

### Referee Mentoring

The evaluation forms for [Intermediate Referee](/docs/Int_Ref_Mentoring.pdf) and [Regional Referee](/docs/Reg_Ref_Mentoring.pdf) are now available.

### Common Excuses for not being a Referee

#### I don't know anything about the game!

All we ask of you is a little of your time and we will train you. The 
training can be done a little at a time or all at once, whichever is 
more convenient for you. We will not ask you to do anything you do not 
feel ready to try. We can guarantee you that, even if you have never 
refereed a game in your life, with a few hours of training, you will 
know more about the game of soccer than most Americans will ever know. 
We can also guarantee you that, if only as spectator, your appreciation 
and enjoyment of the game will increase.
			
#### I don't have the time!

The referees are free to choose the games they can do, which can be 
scheduled at your convenience, possibly just before or after the game 
your child is playing.

#### I don't think I could put up with the behavior of some coaches and spectators!

We do not want our referees to put up with it! Most of the adults and 
players involved in our program are here because we do not allow 
unsportsmanlike behavior. Our region has strict policies governing such 
behavior, and we are strongly committed to these policies. As a referee, 
we can teach you how to deal with these situation in a dignified and 
appropriate manner, and help us maintain the A.Y.S.O philosophy while 
setting a good example for our impressionable young players.

#### I'm not the right kind of person to be a referee, I'd be embarrassed!

All you need is to like kids and like to see them have fun playing 
soccer. We can teach you the rest. There is no need to feel embarrassed 
because we are all volunteers and we all make mistakes, even our most 
experiences referees. We would also make sure that you were always with 
an experienced referee for support.

#### I can't afford the equipment, and besides, I'm a woman and women don't referee!

Women certainly do referee, and make very good ones, too. This is 
exactly why we would like you to volunteer, we would like to have more 
women involved as referees. We provide most of the referee uniform and 
equipment. 

#### I don't think I could keep up with the players. Some of them are pretty fast!

Most of us can't keep up with them either. We give the upper division games, with the faster players, to our fitter and more experienced 
referees. We still have plenty of lower division games on smaller fields 
where you would be able to keep up. Refereeing is also a good way to get 
a little exercise and have fun at the same time. 

#### I don't think I could handle the responsibilities of the referee!

In time you will develop the confidence to referee, but even if you 
don't, you could provide vital assistance to the referee by being an 
assistant referee. We have several qualified referees who only work as 
assistant referees.

All you have to be is 12 years old. We will 
teach you how to referee games for the younger divisions. As a general 
rule, referees only do games for players younger than they are. We have 
a special Youth Referee Administrator and monitors on the fields to 
assist our younger referees.


### Important Referee Instructions

* After each game, put your game cards in your FOLDER MARKED "GAME CARDS"
  located inside the ONSITE STORAGE BIN.  If you need more ref
  cards, please ask your coordinator.
* U16 and U19 - These games are scheduled through the Area referee scheduler.
* U10, U12 and U14 - Ref's should be signing up for games using the Region 55 
  referee scheduler.  Please do not sign up for your own child's game! 
  Don't forget, earning referee points for your team is easy. 
  You need only to do 1 center or 2 lines each Saturday to earn
  your teams required referee points. 
* U6 and U8 - Home team supplies the referee, visiting team should supply the 
	line persons.  However, this is not mandatory!  Please just 
	have fun and keep the games safe and fair for the kids!  If the 
	home team referee is unavailable - any ref (visiting team) can step up 
	and get the game played!
* Girls jerseys. It IS OK for the girls to roll up their jersey sleeves. 
	Although a decision in Law 4 states that "jerseys must have sleeves," 
	both USSF and AYSO do not agree with this decision and allow sleeveless 
	jerseys on the field. The same holds true for teams that roll up their 
	sleeves. This is perfectly legal. Also, velcro straps are allowed to 
	hold the sleeves up provided that they have no metal clips and do not 
	present and danger to themselves or other players on the field.
* We still have many 
	referees signing up to ref their own teams games. Please do not sign up 
	to Referee or be an Assistant Referee for your own team (or the team you 
	are reffing for). This will only cause problems so let's nip it in the 
	bud and end it now. We will begin to remove names from the referee 
	scheduler if we see you signed up to ref your own teams game.

Region 55 will be holding special Referee Field Training clinics 
this Fall.  This training program is designed for new 
Regional level referees, returning Regional level referees who have 
been reffing for 1 or 2 years, or for any Regional level referee who 
wants formalized field training that is unavailable in the Regional 
referee class.
